Description: 
    CEACT (Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Toolkit for Clinical Trials) is a comprehensive R package 
    designed to facilitate the economic evaluation of healthcare interventions in clinical trial settings. 
    It provides tools to compute and visualize Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs), 
    Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curves (CEAC), Cost-Effectiveness Planes, 
    and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) tables. The package streamlines cost-utility analyses 
    and supports both observed and bootstrap-based approaches.
