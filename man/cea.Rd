\title{Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Summary (Observed)}
\usage{
cea(formula, data, ref, na.omit = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A formula of the form \code{cost + effect ~ group}, where:
\itemize{
\item \code{cost} is the numeric column for cost,
\item \code{effect} is the numeric column for effectiveness or utility (e.g., QALYs),
\item \code{group} is a grouping variable with at least two levels.
}}

\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables used in the formula.}

\item{ref}{A character string specifying the reference group in the \code{group} variable (typically "control").}

\item{na.omit}{Logical; whether to remove rows with missing values. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{cea}, which is a data frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{Outcome}{"Mean Cost" or "Mean Effect"}
\item{Control}{Mean and SD for the control group}
\item{Treatment}{Mean and SD for the treatment group}
\item{Delta}{Difference between treatment and control}
\item{CI}{95\% confidence interval for the difference}
\item{p.value}{P-value from a t-test comparing groups}
}
The object also contains attributes for the ICER, formula, reference group, and matched call.
}
\description{
Computes observed summary statistics for a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two groups
(typically control and treatment). This includes mean and standard deviation of cost and effect,
differences (deltas), confidence intervals, p-values from t-tests, and the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  cost = c(rnorm(100, 500, 100), rnorm(100, 600, 120)),
  effect = c(rnorm(100, 0.6, 0.05), rnorm(100, 0.65, 0.06)),
  group = rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = 100)
)
res <- cea(cost + effect ~ group, data = df, ref = "control")
print(res)
