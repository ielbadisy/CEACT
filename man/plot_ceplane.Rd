\title{Plot the Cost-Effectiveness Plane}
\usage{
plot_ceplane(boot_icer_result, k = NULL, subtitle = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{boot_icer_result}{A result object from \code{\link[=boot_icer]{boot_icer()}}, containing the bootstrap distribution
of incremental costs and effects.}

\item{k}{Optional numeric value specifying the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. If provided,
a red line with slope \code{k} is drawn on the plane.}

\item{subtitle}{Optional character string to use as the plot subtitle. If not provided and \code{k}
is specified, the subtitle will default to \code{"WTP Threshold: <k>"}.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object showing the cost-effectiveness plane.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the incremental cost and effect distributions from a bootstrap-based
cost-effectiveness analysis. The cost-effectiveness plane helps assess the uncertainty around
the ICER estimate and its placement within the decision quadrants.
}
\details{
The plot shows:
\itemize{
\item A scatter plot of bootstrapped incremental costs and effects.
\item Vertical and horizontal dashed lines representing zero increments (i.e., origin lines).
\item Optionally, a red diagonal line with slope \code{k} representing the WTP threshold.
}

\examples{
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  c = c(rnorm(100, 500, 100), rnorm(100, 600, 120)),
  e = c(rnorm(100, 0.6, 0.05), rnorm(100, 0.65, 0.06)),
  g = rep(c("control", "treatment"), each = 100)
)

res <- boot_icer(c + e ~ g, data = df, ref = "control", R = 500)
plot_ceplane(res, k = 1000)
